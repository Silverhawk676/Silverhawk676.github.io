Hello, My name is Patrick Gomez. I am a soon to be Mechanical Engineer from the University of Central Florida. From my early aspirations in elementary school to advanced projects today, my journey in mechanical engineering has been driven by a passion for innovation and design. Starting with my FIRST robotics team in high school, I developed soft skills that set me up well for studying engineering in college. A recent internship with Siemens provided clarity on the work I wanted to do, which was much more technical than what I was involved in, motivating me to further improve my technical skills. Currently, I am working with multiple 3D printers, gradually enhancing them and using this as an opportunity to better my design process, streamline my workflows, and hone my documentation practices. As I continue to grow as an engineer, I am eager to accumulate hands-on experience in the field to further my knowledge and skills. I love to learn and am excited to make an impact.
